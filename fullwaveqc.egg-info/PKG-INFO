Description: # FullwaveQC
        
        FullwaveQC is a diagnostic package to assist FWI inversions and timelapse implementation with [Fullwave3D](http://fullwave3d.github.io/)
        Rev689.
        The tools provided by FullwaveQC consist of a series of visualisation and signal processing functions that can be used
        to analyse and quality-check the inversion inputs and outputs of Fullwave3D.
        
        
        ## Installation
        It is recommended that FullwaveQC is installed using the Conda package manager for the software dependcies. Conda can be
        obtained by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for the Python 3.7 version.

            py.test tests
        
        
        compare to true data --> find observed file from fullwave, guarantees same shapes
        check attr for models and data not created by fullwave. can access attr easily to change them
        SEGY files only
