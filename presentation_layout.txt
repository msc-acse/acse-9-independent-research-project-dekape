(0-1)  Title / Introduction to Presentation
(1-2)  Dedicatorias - Total, supervisor
(2-5)  Motivations
	- timelapse
	- Fullwave3D at Total (why switch)
(5-6)  Presentation Outline
(6-11) FWI background
	- do it for someone who's not familiar with inversion or with seismic data
	- What is seismics?
	- Why seismics? What are we trying to achieve in O&G -- with examples
	- The need of inversion to recover model of subsurface properties
	- Inversion theory
	- FWI theory -- workflow
(11-12) Applications of FWI
(12-14) Introduction to Fullwave3D
(14-19) Timelapse theory
(19-23) The limitations of FWI
(23-26) Motivations for QC
	- Important to look at your data
	- Finite difference convergence -- numerical stability and dispersion
	- Identifying and mitigating cycle skipping phenomena
	- Targeted to this project -- limited timeframe -- but able to expand (more features and 3D)
	- Useful for Total, and anyone who plans to use fullwave3D in the future
(26-28) FullwaveQC
	- Present package
(28-30) Present Data
(30-32) Present Data + FullwaveQC + Fullwave3D joint workflow
(32-35) Present Results without QC
(35-38) Present Results with QC
(38-40) Present Results from Diva (reference Total)
(40-43) Conclusions
(43-45) Review
